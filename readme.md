# vbusSpike

`vbusSpike` is an extension of the [SDDS Library (Self-Describing Data Structures)](https://github.com/SDDS/sdds) that adds support for distributing data structures using a binary protocol over an RS-485 interface. This library enables efficient communication and distribution of self-describing data structures in distributed systems and embedded applications.

## Features

- **Extension of SDDS:** Builds on top of the Self-Describing Data Structures (SDDS) Library for efficient data structure management.
- **RS-485 Interface Support:** Implements a binary protocol for data transmission over an RS-485 interface.
- **Efficient Data Transfer:** Ensures low-latency and reliable data transfer for distributed systems.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Designed to work across different platforms and environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use `vbusSpike`, you will need:
- [SDDS Library](https://github.com/mLamneck/SDDS) installed.
